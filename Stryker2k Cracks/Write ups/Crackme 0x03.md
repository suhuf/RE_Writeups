**Hey, let's get started!**

This crackme can be fully solved via two different methods, one longer and more complicated and the other more simple and obvious. Both of these lead to the password being cracked.

In this writeup I am going to try to explain both of these methods through **only** looking at the assembly code in x32 debug, the more complicated method however is much easier to get past using a static disassembler like Ghidra or IDA.


**The solution 1 (simpler):**




**Solution 2 (more detailed):**
